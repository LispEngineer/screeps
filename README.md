# Screeps

[Screeps](https://screeps.com/) is a great game I'm playing with my son to help him learn to program.
It's all programmed in JavaScript (running in [Node 6.6](https://nodejs.org/en/) [`vm`](https://nodejs.org/api/vm.html), 
using [V8 JavaScript engine](https://github.com/v8/v8), 
[implementing most of ECMAScript 2015/6](http://node.green/) [or here](https://kangax.github.io/compat-table/es6/), 
with the [Lodash](https://lodash.com/) library available as `_`), 
and has a reasonably well [documented API](http://support.screeps.com/hc/en-us/articles/203084991-API-Reference).

Here are some modules I'm happy to share with the world and him. If I take a hiatus from playing, I'll share my
entire code base.

# Disclaimer

Note that I don't pretend to be a JavaScript engineer nor a game AI programmer. Indeed, I learned ECMAScript 2015
just for this game; the last thing I had read about JavaScript was almost a decade ago,
[*JavaScript, the Good Parts*](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/9780596517748.do), and I have done almost no
production coding in JavaScript.
